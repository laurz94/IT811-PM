  <h2>üëÅVISION</h2>
  <p>
    Our vision is to not only improve on the current KU Bookstore functionality
    but create additional relevant content. Functionally relevancy and student
    aid are key to this goal, rather than pure profit center model.
  </p>
  <h2>üöÄ MISSION</h2>
  <p>
    Our Mission is to unite students around the KU Bookstore as a foundation,
    rather than a burden. Streamlined Payment Process Merchandise upgrade &
    Features Student Services
  </p>
  <h2>üîÆ STRATEGIES</h2>
  <p>
    Shape the KU Bookstore website into a pro-student offering. If the KU
    Bookstore operated pro-student, then local third-party stores would not
    exist. The KU Bookstore needs to match and exceed what is provided by
    third-party venues.

        Laura is a Software Architect at Moonshot Innovations. She has a passion
        for leading teams, JavaScript, and learning new technologies. Recently she
        has been learning cloud computing and building scalable applications with
        Azure.
      </p>

      <h3>Project Roles</h3>
      <p>
        Laura will be serving as the project's architect and developer.

      <div>
        <p>
          Laura has worked in multiple project environments, including waterfall,
          scrum, and Kanban, over her 9-year career in software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Laura has excellent leadership skills. She successfully ran a major
          project as the technical lead. For 3 years, she led 13 teams across 3
          continents coordinating efforts and ensuring every team knew the plan
          and executed it accordingly. At the same time, she led her own framework
          team, which tackled the hardest to solve problems of the system.

          Today she makes architectural and UI/UX decisions. She discusses ideas
          with leadership, puts the vision into wireframes so everyone can
          visualize what will be built, and then creates high-level architecture
          documents. She also works closely with teams to make sure they clearly
          understand what they are building and how.
